# Teen Alcohol Outcomes Study (TAOS)

## Study Description

Children (aged 12-15 years old) were recruited as part of TAOS (N = 330). The longitudinal dataset classified children as high or low familial risk for depression and included behavioral questionnaires and MRI scans. 

For more information, please contact Peter Kochunov (Peter.Kochunov@uth.tmc.edu).

## Available Data

The diffusion MRI scans were processed using the [ENIGMA-DTI](https://github.com/ENIGMA-git) pipeline (originally for Kochunov, 2014). The subset of data used in [Zhu, et al.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.22.581646v2) is made available here. The spreadsheet contains age, sex, and regional fractional anisotropy (FA) measures, filtered to include one child per family (N = 232).
